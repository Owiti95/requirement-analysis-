# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository explores the critical first phase of the software development life cycle — **Requirement Analysis**. Its purpose is to document and examine the processes, techniques, and tools used to gather, analyze, and define the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.

By organizing these concepts, this repository serves as a learning resource and reference point for developers, students, and professionals seeking to improve their understanding of effective requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders and project teams collaborate to gather, analyze, and define the software system’s functional and non-functional requirements. This process ensures everyone involved has a shared understanding of what the system is expected to do and how it should behave.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding**: Helps identify and clarify stakeholder needs, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition**: Establishes clear boundaries for the project to avoid scope creep.
- **Foundation for Design & Development**: Acts as the blueprint for system architecture and implementation.
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Enables realistic budgeting and scheduling.
- **Quality Assurance**: Sets expectations that the final product must meet, improving customer satisfaction.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - Interviews, surveys, observation, workshops, and document analysis.
2. **Requirement Elicitation**
   - Brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping for deeper insights.
3. **Requirement Documentation**
   - Specification documents, user stories, and use case diagrams.
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
   - Prioritizing, feasibility checks, and creating visual models (e.g., data flow diagrams).
5. **Requirement Validation**
   - Reviews, stakeholder approvals, defining acceptance criteria, and maintaining traceability.

### Types of Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
Describe **what** the system should do.
Examples:
- Search properties
- User registration & authentication
- Booking system
- Property listing display

#### Non-functional Requirements
Describe **how** the system should perform.
Examples:
- Load speed (< 2 seconds)
- Scalability to 1000+ users
- Data security & encryption
- 99.9% uptime reliability
